Hi Giulio

I didn't know how to contact you, so I am trying this method of a pull request.
I am currenty in my last year of studying Computer Science at the ZHAW in Switzerland. 
My partner and I are doing a research on how reliable machine learning is. For this, we are using a PYNQ Z2 Board. We came across this library and are using it for our research. However, we would like to modify some of the things in the library. Now, we are not sure how to compile and generate the shared objects. Thus we would like to ask you for a little help.

My email address is "lauale01@students.zhaw.ch". I am looking forward to hearing from you. Sorry for the inconvenience in contacting you over this pull request, as I did not know any other way to do so. 

Kind Regards
Alex
